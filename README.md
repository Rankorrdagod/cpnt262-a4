### Evan Burton
## Instructions for CLI use
The CLI used is pulled from the data in the OpenWeather API, and should pull the current weather, longitude and latitude for ANY city you enter (provided it is in the database).
- Example: "node app.js Hongkong" (this will return with information on Hongkong)
- install chalk
- npm install chalk
- Run the same code or switch to any city you would like and notice the update in colors in the CLI.
- While this runs through app.js most of the code is located in weather.js, including the chalk code (lines 3, 28)
